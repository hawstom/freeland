;This section shows how to override program size/scale defaults
;if you want to use a custom sized notes table.
;To use overrides, change the NOTEQTY block to meet your needs, then
;remove the semi-colon from any of the SET lines below that need 
;to be changed, and adjust their values to fit your custom block.
;TXTHT is in AutoCAD units.
;The other values are text height multiples.
;You may remove this section from this file without hurting NOTES.
;Note: Notes table column width is iniwid+ntwid+tqwid+quwid+finwid
;SET TXTHT 20         AutoCAD text size (height)
;SET TNWID 5          Width from middle of shape type to number (tally table only)
;SET INIWID 2.5       Width from left edge of column to middle of number
;SET NDWID 2.5        Width from middle of number to left point of description text
;SET DQWID 56         Width from left point of description text to right point of quantity
;SET QQWID 9          Width from right point of quantity to right point of next quantity
;SET QUWID 1          Width from right point of quantity to left point of unit
;SET FINWID 3         Width from left point of unit to right edge of column
;SET LINSPC 3         Line spacing (row height)
;The following settings are required if you are using aliases 
;for the phase attributes in your NOTEQTY block.
;Remove the semi-colon, and place the setting for each phase as shown below.
;Type the alias for the appropriate phase into the NOTEPHASE attribute of each bubble note.
SET PHASEALIAS 1 M   The TBLQTY1 tagged attribute of the NOTEQTY block will receive quantities from bubble notes with an M instead of a 1 in the NOTEPHASE attribute value
SET PHASEALIAS 2 1   The TBLQTY2 tagged attribute of the NOTEQTY block will receive quantities from bubble notes with an 1 instead of a 2 in the NOTEPHASE attribute value
;SET PHASEALIAS 3 2   The TBLQTY3 tagged attribute of the NOTEQTY block will receive quantities from bubble notes with an 3 in the NOTEPHASE attribute value
;SET PHASEALIAS 4 3   The TBLQTY4 tagged attribute of the NOTEQTY block will receive quantities from bubble notes with an 4 in the NOTEPHASE attribute value
