# Welcome to FreeLand
Welcome to the FreeLand suite of Civil Engineering tools started by Thomas Gail Haws. These tools are AutoCAD commands ready for AutoCAD users who have no knowledge of AutoLISP beyond how to load a file. Please contact me if you need any help using or modifying these tools.

# List of tools
- Civil 3D Subdivision Lot Elevator: See [at Youtube](https://youtu.be/OkHoKr-nJKU)
  - It elevates pad feature lines following your rules and your specified dirt balance bias wherever there is wiggle room. You select street elevation labels. 
  - It elevates back yard feature line vertices following your rules. You select surrounding pad feature lines.
- Curve, Line, and Point Table Creator: You select arcs, lines, or points. It labels them and creates a table to present their geometry. Tables like this are used by Surveyors and Civil Engineers. See [at hawsedc.com](https://hawsedc.com/gnu/curvesauto) and [at Blogspot](https://tomsthird.blogspot.com/2015/01/geotables-free-curve-line-and-point.html).
- Curve Tables Simple: You insert label blocks. You insert table blocks. It puts curve data into the blocks. See at [at hawsedc.com](https://hawsedc.com/gnu/curvesmanual) and [at Youtube](https://youtu.be/u8-3TwPjamw).
- DDMSW Maps Exporter: You draw watershed property polylines. It copies them to dedicated layers and exports "shapefile" maps from them for Maricopa County, Arizona, USA Drainage Design Management System for Windows. See [at hawsedc.com](https://hawsedc.com/gnu/ddmsw.php), [Youtube](https://youtu.be/e59g8UMujbI), and [Blogspot](https://tomsthird.blogspot.com/2017/03/automated-autocad-gis-export-to-ddmsw.html).
- Grading and Drainage Designer: It helps you design site grading. It acts to some extent like Civil 3D feature lines. See [at hawsedc.com](https://hawsedc.com/gnu/gdd.php) and at wikia.com](https://autocad.fandom.com/wiki/Grading_and_Drainage_Designer_(AutoLISP_application)).
- Profile Labeler: It helps you add labels productively to civil engineering profiles. See at [hawsedc.com](https://hawsedc.com/gnu/proflbl.php).
- Proliferate: It proliferates your selected objects by copying them successively aligned with each object in a selection set or with points you specify. See at [Youtube](https://youtu.be/NgT_VaJvk6A).
- Sewer Lateral Importer: Commissioned by Apache Junction Sewer District to draw sewer laterals between two manholes based on a CSV file of video observations.
- Sewer Lateral Repositioner: Commissioned by Apache Junction Sewer District to move a sewer lateral object to a new distance from the main line endpoint.
- Subdivision Grading Plan Labeler: You enter the "average" project elevation. You select a controlling street elevation. It helps you label points on a lot that you select one at a time. See at [hawsedc.com](https://hawsedc.com/gnu/gradlbl.php).
- Survey Points Importer: It inserts point blocks by importing points from a standard text file in a variety of formats. See at [hawsedc.com](https://hawsedc.com/gnu/pointsin.php).
- Turning Path Tracker: You select a front wheel path polyline. It draws the resulting rear wheel paths and intermediate positions of a vehicle whose front wheels follow your polyline. See at [hawsedc.com](https://hawsedc.com/gnu/turn.php) and [Youtube](https://youtu.be/DmHMUyquoSI).
